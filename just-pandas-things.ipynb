    "Pandas is built around `DataFrame`, a concept inspired by R's Data Frame, which is, in turn, similar to tables in relational databases. A `DataFrame` is a two-dimentional table with rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to know about pandas is that it's column-major, which explains many of its quirks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column-major means consecutive elements in a column are stored next to each other in memory. Row-major means the same but for elements in a row. Because modern computers process sequential data more efficiently than nonsequential data, if a table is row-major, accessing its rows will be much faster than accessing its columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, major order can be specified. When a `ndarray` is created, it's row-major by default if you don't specify the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like R's Data Frame, pandas' `DataFrame` is column-major. People coming to pandas from NumPy tend to treat `DataFrame` the way they would `ndarray`, e.g. trying to access data by rows, and find `DataFrame` slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: A column in a `DataFrame` is a `Series`. You can think of a `DataFrame` as a bunch of `Series` being stored next to each other in memory.\n",

    "## 6. Common pitfalls\n",
    "pandas is great for most day-to-day data analysis. It's instrumental to my job and I'm grateful that the entire pandas community is actively developing it. However, I think some of pandas design decisions are a bit questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common pandas pitfalls:\n",
    "### 6.1 NaNs\n",
    "NaNs are stored as floats in pandas, so when an operation fails because of NaNs, it doesn't say that there's a NaN but because that operation doesn't exist for floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Changes not Inplace \n",
    "Most pandas operations aren't inplace by default, so if you make changes to your `DataFrame`, you need to assign the changes back to your DataFrame. You can make changes inplace by setting argument `inplace=True`."
